# Roomba Dirt Hunt!

A web-application that shows the valiant efforts of a cute knife-wielding roomba in search of dirt on a grid. During development, arrow controls were implemented to create a game application. Further iterations on this concept will be implemented to create a game complete with leader boards and enhanced graphics.

## Motivation

I was given a challenge to create a grid that contained dirt piles on certain squares. Then I was asked to give a set of directions for the roomba to execute on auto-pilot. During its journey, I was to update its status and progress. A stat-box displays general information, and a stat-table displays the results of each turn.
